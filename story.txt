Grandmother always told us to stay away from the valley.
Ezichiel listened well.


Hey.
Hey.


Cow dung, there just aren't enough words

Our language only has one way to say love, this is something more rare, don't you see?

I wondered then if I should have told him how silly he was being
Getting all worked up about a poem
It was just words





There aren't enough words

In the dark.


The library streches beyond me



I know exactly how much bread , 


of course brother never listened.
The library

It all started with a girl.
